## Introduction

In software development, testing is crucial. However, testing time-dependent code can be tricky. The standard `time.Now()` function retrieves the current time, making it hard to predict results. **ctxtime** solves this issue by providing a mockable time function.

By using **ctxtime**, you can control the flow of time in your tests, ensuring that your code behaves as expected, regardless of the actual time when tests run.

## Features

- **Mockable Time**: Easily replace `time.Now()` with a controllable time source.
- **Testable Code**: Write tests that are predictable and repeatable.
- **Simple API**: Use a straightforward interface to set and get time.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for easy integration.

## Installation

To get started with **ctxtime**, you need to install it in your Go project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/chay-10-cell/ctxtime
```

## Usage

Using **ctxtime** is simple. First, import the package in your Go file:

```go
import "github.com/chay-10-cell/ctxtime"
```

Next, you can set the current time using `ctxtime.SetNow()`. This function allows you to define a specific time that will be returned when you call `ctxtime.Now()`.

### Setting the Time

Hereâ€™s how you can set the time:

```go
ctxtime.SetNow(time.Date(2023, time.October, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
```

### Getting the Time

To retrieve the current time, use:

```go
currentTime := ctxtime.Now()
fmt.Println(currentTime) // Outputs: 2023-10-10 10:00:00 +0000 UTC
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how to use **ctxtime** effectively.

### Example 1: Simple Test Case

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/chay-10-cell/ctxtime"
)

func main() {
    ctxtime.SetNow(time.Date(2023, time.October, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
    
    fmt.Println("Current Time:", ctxtime.Now())
}
```

### Example 2: Testing with Mocked Time

You can also use **ctxtime** in your tests to ensure that your time-dependent functions behave correctly.

```go
package mypackage

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/chay-10-cell/ctxtime"
)

func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    ctxtime.SetNow(time.Date(2023, time.October, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
    
    result := MyFunction()
    
    if result != expectedValue {
        t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expectedValue, result)
    }
}
```
